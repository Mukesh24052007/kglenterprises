        <h2>Our Services</h2>
        <p>
          We help with <strong>paddy farming</strong>—from cultivation, puddling, and planting
          to harvesting, baling, and transporting bales from one place to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          For <strong>groundnut farming</strong>, we’ve got you covered too—cultivation,
          seeding, harvesting, and threshing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We buy both paddy and groundnuts directly from farmers, offering
          <strong> fair prices</strong> and a smooth process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Need to transport agricultural goods? We’ll take care of it—<strong>no matter the product or destination</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also <strong>sell tractors and farm equipment</strong>, and if you’re looking to sell yours,
          we offer <strong>park & sell</strong> services too.
        </p>
        <p>
          And many more services to support farmers and agricultural businesses. From machinery to harvest,
          from transport to trade—we’re here for <strong>every step of the journey</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in building <strong>long-term relationships</strong>, not just providing services.
          Agriculture is more than a business to us—it’s a <strong>way of life</strong>,
          and we’re proud to stand beside the people who grow our future.
